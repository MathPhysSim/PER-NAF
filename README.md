# PER-NAF
An implementation of the Normalized Advantage Function Reinforcement Learning Algorithm with Prioritized Experience Replay

* The original paper of this code is: https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971
* The code is mainly based on: https://github.com/carpedm20/NAF-tensorflow/
* Additionally I added the prioritized experience replay: https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05952
* Using the OpenAI baseline implementation: https://github.com/openai/baselines/blob/master/baselines/deepq/replay_buffer.py

Thanks openAI and Kim!
