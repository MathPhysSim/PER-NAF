def _l2_project(z_p, p, z_q):
    """Projects distribution (z_p, p) onto support z_q under L2-metric over CDFs.
    The supports z_p and z_q are specified as tensors of distinct atoms (given
    in ascending order).
    Let Kq be len(z_q) and Kp be len(z_p). This projection works for any
    support z_q, in particular Kq need not be equal to Kp.
    Args:
      z_p: Tensor holding support of distribution p, shape `[batch_size, Kp]`.
      p: Tensor holding probability values p(z_p[i]), shape `[batch_size, Kp]`.
      z_q: Tensor holding support to project onto, shape `[Kq]`.
    Returns:
      Projection of (z_p, p) onto support z_q under Cramer distance.
